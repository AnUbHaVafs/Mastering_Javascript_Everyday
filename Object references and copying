Summary :
1). You can use : for in loop to iterate over the object's properties and clone them into new object. (for shallow copy).
2). For deep cloning using above method : use recursion and perform the same method as in above step whenever you encounter object type in properties.
3). Object.assign(dest, ...) - for shallow copy.
4). structuredClone(obj) - for deep copy (not work for values as functions, undefined, symbols).
5). Use clone = {...obj} - spread operator.
