Making the relationship between the json file having constant data and the cyrpess tests from implicit to explicit.
If I'll change the order of the data OR If I'll add one more data, the former will results into error since the tests are written using hard-coded data and later one we are nit testing, since there is no tests for it written.
So the current relationship is implicit and here we are going to change it to the explicit.
Till now in fixtures, the tests are testing whether the data which is loaded is getting rendered correctly!


/// moving on to the using high level roles instead very low-level classes.
using testing-library, findByRole : the roles exists in the browser itself and some elements gets roles and all elements can get roles. which then we can query. instead of using specific (nested) classes structure.
There is a variant for each query that is appended with "All"
Now, we are no longer dependent on the browser DOM structure, rather we are only concerned about the conceptulised elements.
You should alwasy make an assertion on top of your queries , bevasue if you don't then you will not came to know where the test has been failed and raather all remaining tests will get passed , OOPS!
MUst use should('exists')

how to access the api and the data using cypress --- means explore cy.route() and cy.server()
